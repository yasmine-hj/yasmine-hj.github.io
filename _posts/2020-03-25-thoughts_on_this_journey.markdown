### *“Everyone can benefit from learning the basics of computer science. The questions it teaches you to ask — How do you accomplish a task? Can you find a pattern? What data do you need? — are useful no matter where you go in life.” - Bill Gates*


Learning to code has been a life changing experience for me. I really feel like I can do anything I set my mind to. 
I learnt that I could be stuck on a problem for hours or days and find the issue was the smallest sillyest typo. I learnt that it's okay to need help, and that google can be your bestfriend sometimes. I learnt that I know more than I think I do, but I also don't know so much. I learnt that there's always so much to learn and the learning never ends, and I learnt that there's so much left to build and create. I learnt about the importance in patience when learning something new. 

Most importantly, I learnt how to think in a way I never use to think in before.

I've now completed my course at Flatiron School but the journey has not ended, l am grateful to be on this journey and I'm excited to keep on learning!
