Another project complete and I’m amazed by how much I’ve learnt from it. 

Starting this project was quite daunting because I was a little behind during the Rails part of the course and took a while catching up.

I started out by drawing out my models, which made things a whole lot easier for me. 

I then used the `devise` gem which was super helpful at sorting all the user login and signup side of things. I used plenty of `form_for` and `link_to` erb tags in my views and active record validations came really handy in my models. `Omniauth` however took me many hours of trial and error to implement (it's really not supposed to take that long!), but was the most satisfying to see it work when it finally did! And I'm grateful for all the hours I put in I was reminded how incredibly rewarding it is to actually fixing broken code and figuring things out. 

My favorite thing about these projects is realising I actually understand and know. And how much I don't know too! I'm really excited to start JS now.
